# Problem Interpretation

A potential customer is evaluating Nebius.ai before committing to a large
GPU reservation (512× H100 for 6 months).

The goal of this PoC is to:
1. Discover and validate the actual cluster environment provided.
2. Verify that the infrastructure is suitable for ML workloads
   (GPU, networking, storage).
3. Demonstrate a representative ML workload (training or inference).

This document follows a facts-first approach:
environment discovery → infrastructure validation → PoC workload.
